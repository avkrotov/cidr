`cidr' is an utility to convert between IP ranges and CIDR blocks.

`cidr' replaces another public domain tool cidr-convert.c [1], but it
is not based on it. Instead of complex tree data structure and recursive
printing algorithm, `cidr' uses linked list, insertion sort and iterative
algorithm for printing.
